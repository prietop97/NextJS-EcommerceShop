## Project Overview

Easy-to-use, ‘cloud application’ that gives the owner the ability to sell their products online. Owner would also be able to edit store information and style if they decide to sell something completly different in the future.

### Key Features

- Admin CMS
- Add/Update/Delete products and categories
- Update store colors and fonts
- View store and purchase products using Stripe

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### Front end framework is NextJS

- Familiarity is one the biggest advantage using NextJS, everyone can start coding from day one.
- A popular React framework that is fast, scalable, simple, and maintained by a lot of developers.
- I'm likely to have a need to reuse modular units of code (due to products) that will appear in our various routes/views.
- I also want something that is performant, easy to maintain/extend and SEO friendly.


## Styled Components - an add-on for creating dynamic styles directly in NextJS components.

- Use Case: Having a base library implemented for overall site styling will cover most use cases, but we may need more flexibility on a per-component basis and the ability to add/alter styles dynamically based user interaction/the state of the application, and Styled Components can provide this.
- Pros: easy to use, easy to create, can make them custom
